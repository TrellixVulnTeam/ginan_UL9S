Ginan is an open source toolkit for creating precise point positioning (PPP) analysis products, correction streams and positions. It is being actively developed in a Geoscience Australia Positioning Australia program.

The source code for the current version of Ginan is available for download from [this site](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ginan). New versions of Ginan with enhanced capabilities will be developed and released over time.

In the future, Geoscience Australia will establish operational instances of Ginan that produce PPP analysis products and streams on a continuous basis and which will be available free of charge to the public.
