# PEA examples

In this section we go through a number of different ways that the pea can be used to process GNSS data.

1. Precise Point Positioning (PPP) processing - In this section we will demonstrate how to processing in PPP mode using the Ionosphere free combination, we will provide an example on how to use IGS products to obtain a float solution, and then an example on how to obtain an ambiguity fixed solution. We will also cover how to process gnss streams in real-time.
